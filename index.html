            <h3>About<br>Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my little corner of the Internet ! My name is Isha and I am an emerging web
                developer currently embarking on my Fullstack journey with Carleton and edX bootcamps. Prior to this, my
                academic training was in biochemistry with practical experience in developing prototype nano-carriers
                with Health Canada. I owe great thanks and respect to the instructors and mentors that guided me into
                the quizzical and methodical thinking that is required for scientific research and discovery. With time
                I came to realise that working at the bench was not the passion that I would wish to continue to pursue.
                The exploding and exciting field of software and web development enticed me into looking at what options
                were available to me. While I am excited to learn this new skill, I am avidly curious of how to bridge
                the gap between this field and that of science. With my practical experience in scientific methods,
                experiment design, and technical report reading and writing, I hope to find the medium that can express
                the portfolio I have built.
                <br><br>
                Below are the works I have completed to date; I hope you enjoy your stay.
            </p>
